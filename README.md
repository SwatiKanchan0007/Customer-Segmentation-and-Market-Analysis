# Customer-Segmentation-and-Market-Analysis_-RFM-
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a Customer Segmentation Analysis for an online retail company. The analysis will be performed using the RFM Model, which stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary. RFM analysis is a behavior-based approach that involves grouping customers into distinct segments based on their previous purchase transactions.

The RFM model analyzes three key aspects of customer behavior:

Recency (R): This refers to the time since a customer's last purchase. Customers who have made more recent purchases are likely to be more engaged and active.

Frequency (F): This represents the number of transactions made by a customer within a specific time period. Customers with higher frequency indicate loyal and consistent buyers.

Monetary Value (M): This measures the total monetary value of a customer's purchases over a particular period. Customers with higher monetary value contribute significantly to the company's revenue.

By combining these three metrics, the RFM analysis aims to divide customers into distinct segments, allowing the company to identify valuable customer groups and target them more effectively.

In this analysis 11 customer segments have been created , each representing a unique group of customers with varying levels of recency, frequency, and monetary value. Understanding these segments will help the online retail company tailor its marketing and sales strategies to cater to the specific needs and preferences of each segment. The insights gained will help the company target specific customer groups to enhance sales revenue and optimize marketing strategies for improved customer engagement and loyalty.
